This project uses a simulated dataset of 500 Indian consumers to explore value-driven purchasing behavior in the automobile sector, particularly comparing electric vehicles (EVs) to traditional internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles. The dataset includes attributes such as:

Cost sensitivity

Fuel efficiency importance

Awareness of government incentives

Total cost of ownership (TCO) for EVs vs. ICE

Consumer preferences, location, and occupation

The goal is to identify price-sensitive consumers who may prefer EVs for their long-term cost-effectiveness.

 Conclusion
The analysis reveals that:

Highly cost-sensitive consumers (ratings 4–5) and those who value fuel efficiency tend to prefer EVs.

Urban working professionals are more likely to favor EVs, influenced by greater exposure to incentives and rising fuel prices.

On average, EVs have lower total ownership costs compared to ICE vehicles in the dataset.

Government incentives and maintenance awareness positively impact consumer interest in EVs.

➡ Electric vehicles strongly appeal to value-oriented Indian consumers, especially in urban areas, due to their long-term savings and lower operational costs.
